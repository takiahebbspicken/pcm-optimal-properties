	abstractNote={Lithium-ion battery performance is strongly dependent on thermal conditions, deteriorating dramatically at low temperatures. Herein, a passive thermal management system utilizing RT28/fumed silica composite phase change materials (PCMs) is evaluated for a lithium-ion battery at temperatures below 5 °C. Taking advantage of the high thermal energy storage capacity, PCMs can store heat and keep a battery warm. The cells with PCMs take much longer before being too cold than cells without PCMs. The improved thermal conditions lead to higher voltages and discharge capacities. In the long term, PCMs increase the average temperature of the battery in continuous cycles and prolong their cycle life by up to 76 %. But the extra thermal mass of the PCM slows the temperature rise so that the cell with PCM fails to perform well at the beginning stages in cold environments. Saving phase: Increased temperatures improve the material properties of batteries, leading to increased discharge power, reduced capacity losses, and prolonged cycle life at low temperatures. Phase-change materials provide large, extra thermal mass to batteries, reducing temperature fluctuations and raising the average temperature of the batteries working in cold environments (below 5 °C). The phase change can be exploited to store thermal energy.},

	abstractNote={ In this paper, an extensive review of a battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) such as phase-change materials (PCMs) in the state of art is proposed. Nowadays, PCMs are particularly attractive and chosen as one of the most interesting cooling system in terms of high-energy storage density. In addition, they are less bulky, complex and expensive than traditional cooling methods such as forced-air cooling or liquid cooling. Nonetheless, the integration of PCMs in a battery application calls for an analysis that will enable the researcher to proposed optimized BTMSs. Indeed, due to the lack of literature in this domain, the paper proposed to review all the existing studies on battery applications involving PCMs. Numerical analysis description, heat transfer theory along with the classification of the existing components for PCMs are also presented. This paper is based on previous reviews to help to update the thin number of references, which is considered by the authors as the major contribution.},

	abstractNote={ Electric vehicles play a crucial role in reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions for more sustainable transportation. Lithium-ion batteries, as the most expensive but least understood component in electric vehicles, directly affect vehicular driving range, safety, comfort, and reliability. However, the overall performance of traction batteries deteriorates significantly at low temperatures due to the reduced electrochemical reaction rate and accelerated health degradation, such as lithium plating. Without timely and effective actions, this performance degradation causes operational difficulties and safety hazards for electric vehicles. Battery warm-up/preheating is of particular importance when operating electric vehicles in cold geographical regions. To this end, this paper reviews various battery preheating strategies, including external convective and conductive preheating, as well as the latest progress in internal heating solutions. The effects of low temperature on batteries from the perspectives of cell performance as well as materials properties are briefly summarized. Thermal science issues involved in warm-up are also elucidated. The framework of battery management systems (BTMS) at low temperatures, including the key design considerations at different battery integration levels and the overall classification of warm-up approaches into external and internal groups, are introduced in detail. Next, a comprehensive literature review on different warm-up strategies is presented, and the basic principles, advantages, disadvantages, and potential improvements of each strategy are elaborated. Finally, future trends of battery warm-up methods are discussed in terms of key technologies, promising opportunities, and challenges.},

	DOI={10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.009}, 
	abstractNote={The power and energy densities of battery will decrease at cold temperature and the heat preservation is necessary to keep the working temperature. In this paper, the lattice Boltzmann model for phase change material based battery thermal management cold temperature is constructed and the effects of thermal conductivity, latent heat and environmental temperature have been considered. The results show that with the latent heat of phase change material (PCM), the temperature of battery decreases slowly and the temperature distribution can be guaranteed. However, once the PCM adjacent to the interface of battery and PCM, the temperature of battery drops faster and the temperature standard deviation rises sharply. Besides, the lower thermal conductivity, greater latent heat and higher environmental temperature are able to slow down the solidification process of PCM and keeps the temperature of battery. However, with larger latent heat of PCM, the battery temperature distribution gets more non-uniform, which is able to decrease the cycle life of battery.},
